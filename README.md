| ðŸŽ‰ Deadcord v2 is in development! |
| ----------------------------------|
| After Deadcord v1, many poeple asked for a second overhauled version. The new v2 version will be very different to Deadcord v1. This new version is currently being worked on, but may be delayed due to my priority being on other projects at the moment. A Discord server for this project will be released soon. Stay tuned. |
